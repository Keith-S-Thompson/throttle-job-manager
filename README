This is throttle-job-manager release 0.1.

The throttle-job-manager command is a Perl script that works around
a Globus performance problem by throttling the number of active
globus-job-manager processes running on a system.  It works only on
Linux.  See <http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1142>
for a description of the problem.  See the man page for details on
the throttle-job-manager command.

There is no configuration or installation script.

"throttle-job-manager" is the command itself; install it in an
appropriate directory, adjust the "#!/usr/bin/perl" line if necessary
to reflect the location of your Perl executable, and run it as root.

"throttle-job-manager.1" is the man page.
